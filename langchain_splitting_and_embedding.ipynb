      "French Armies who had entered Belgium at the appeal of the Belgian King; but this strategic fact\n",
      "this strategic fact was\n",
      "not immediately realized. The French High Command hoped they would be able to close the gap, and\n",
      "the Armies of the north were under their orders. Moreover, a retirement of this kind would have\n",
      "involved almost certainly the destruction of the fine Belgian Army of over 20 divisions and the\n",
      "abandonment of the whole of Belgium. Therefore, when the force and scope of the German\n",
      "penetration were realized and when a new French Generalissimo, General Weygand, assumed\n",
      "command in place of General Gamelin, an effort was made by the French and British Armies in\n",
      "Belgium to keep on holding the right hand of the Belgians and to give their own right hand to a\n",
      "own right hand to a newly\n",
      "created French Army which was to have advanced across the Somme in great strength to grasp it.\n",
      "However, the German eruption swept like a sharp scythe around the right and rear of the Armies of\n",
      "the north. Eight or nine armored divisions, each of about four hundred armored vehicles of\n",
      "armored vehicles of different\n",
      "kinds, but carefully assorted to be complementary and divisible into small self-contained units,\n",
      "units, cut off\n",
      "all communications between us and the main French Armies. It severed our own communications for\n",
      "food and ammunition, which ran first to Amiens and afterwards through Abbeville, and it shore its\n",
      "way up the coast to Boulogne and Calais, and almost to Dunkirk. Behind this armored and\n",
      "mechanized onslaught came a number of German divisions in lorries, and behind them again there\n",
      "plodded comparatively slowly the dull brute mass of the ordinary German Army and German people,\n",
      "always so ready to be led to the trampling down in other lands of liberties and comforts which they\n",
      "have never known in their own.\n",
      "I have said this armored scythe-stroke almost reached Dunkirk-almost but not quite. Boulogne and\n",
      "Calais were the scenes of desperate fighting. The Guards defended Boulogne for a while and were\n",
      "then withdrawn by orders from this country. The Rifle Brigade, the 60th Rifles, and the Queen\n",
      "Victoria's Rifles, with a battalion of British tanks and 1,000 Frenchmen, in all about four\n",
      "in all about four thousand\n",
      "strong, defended Calais to the last. The British Brigadier was given an hour to surrender. He\n",

      "the offer, and four days of intense street fighting passed before silence reigned over Calais,\n",
      "over Calais, which\n",
      "marked the end of a memorable resistance. Only 30 unwounded survivors were brought off by the\n",
      "Navy, and we do not know the fate of their comrades. Their sacrifice, however, was not in vain. At\n",
      "least two armored divisions, which otherwise would have been turned against the British\n",
      "Expeditionary Force, had to be sent to overcome them. They have added another page to the glories\n",
      "of the light divisions, and the time gained enabled the Graveline water lines to be flooded and to\n",
      "be flooded and to be\n",
      "held by the French troops.\n",
      "Thus it was that the port of Dunkirk was kept open. When it was found impossible for the Armies of\n",
      "the north to reopen their communications to Amiens with the main French Armies, only one choice\n",
      "remained. It seemed, indeed, forlorn. The Belgian, British and French Armies were almost\n",
      "surrounded. Their sole line of retreat was to a single port and to its neighboring beaches. They\n",
      "beaches. They were\n",
      "pressed on every side by heavy attacks and far outnumbered in the air.\n",
      "When, a week ago today, I asked the House to fix this afternoon as the occasion for a statement, I\n",
      "feared it would be my hard lot to announce the greatest military disaster in our long history. I\n",
      "thought-and some good judges agreed with me-that perhaps 20,000 or 30,000 men might be reembarked.\n",
      "be reembarked. But it certainly seemed that the whole of the French First Army and the whole of the\n",
      "British Expeditionary Force north of the Amiens-Abbeville gap would be broken up in the open field\n",
      "or else would have to capitulate for lack of food and ammunition. These were the hard and heavy\n",
      "tidings for which I called upon the House and the nation to prepare themselves a week ago. The\n",
      "a week ago. The whole\n",
      "root and core and brain of the British Army, on which and around which we were to build, and are to\n",
      "build, the great British Armies in the later years of the war, seemed about to perish upon the\n",
      "to perish upon the field or\n",
      "to be led into an ignominious and starving captivity.\n",
      "That was the prospect a week ago. But another blow which might well have proved final was yet to\n",

      "Had not this Ruler and\n",

      "the French and\n",
      "British Armies might well at the outset have saved not only Belgium but perhaps even Poland. Yet at\n",
      "the last moment, when Belgium was already invaded, King Leopold called upon us to come to his aid,\n",
      "and even at the last moment we came. He and his brave, efficient Army, nearly half a million\n",
      "half a million strong,\n",
      "guarded our left flank and thus kept open our only line of retreat to the sea. Suddenly, without\n",
      "Suddenly, without prior\n",
      "consultation, with the least possible notice, without the advice of his Ministers and upon his own\n",
      "personal act, he sent a plenipotentiary to the German Command, surrendered his Army, and exposed\n",
      "our whole flank and means of retreat.\n",
      "I asked the House a week ago to suspend its judgment because the facts were not clear, but I do not\n",
      "feel that any reason now exists why we should not form our own opinions upon this pitiful episode.\n",
      "The surrender of the Belgian Army compelled the British at the shortest notice to cover a flank to\n",
      "to cover a flank to the\n",
      "sea more than 30 miles in length. Otherwise all would have been cut off, and all would have shared\n",
      "the fate to which King Leopold had condemned the finest Army his country had ever formed. So in\n",
      "doing this and in exposing this flank, as anyone who followed the operations on the map will see,\n",
      "contact was lost between the British and two out of the three corps forming the First French Army,\n",
      "who were still farther from the coast than we were, and it seemed impossible that any large number\n",
      "any large number of\n",
      "Allied troops could reach the coast.\n",
      "The enemy attacked on all sides with great strength and fierceness, and their main power, the power\n",
      "of their far more numerous Air Force, was thrown into the battle or else concentrated upon Dunkirk\n",
      "and the beaches. Pressing in upon the narrow exit, both from the east and from the west, the enemy\n",
      "began to fire with cannon upon the beaches by which alone the shipping could approach or depart.\n",
      "They sowed magnetic mines in the channels and seas; they sent repeated waves of hostile aircraft,\n",
      "sometimes more than a hundred strong in one formation, to cast their bombs upon the single pier\n",
      "the single pier that\n",
      "remained, and upon the sand dunes upon which the troops had their eyes for shelter. Their U-boats,\n",
      "one of which was sunk, and their motor launches took their toll of the vast traffic which now\n",
      "traffic which now began.\n",
      "For four or five days an intense struggle reigned. All their armored divisions-or what Was left of\n",
      "them-together with great masses of infantry and artillery, hurled themselves in vain upon the\n",
      "in vain upon the evernarrowing, ever-contracting appendix within which the British and French\n",
      "British and French Armies fought.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Royal Navy, with the willing help of countless merchant seamen, strained every nerve\n",
      "to embark the British and Allied troops; 220 light warships and 650 other vessels were engaged.\n",
      "were engaged. They\n",
      "had to operate upon the difficult coast, often in adverse weather, under an almost ceaseless hail\n",
      "ceaseless hail of\n",
      "bombs and an increasing concentration of artillery fire. Nor were the seas, as I have said,\n",
      "as I have said, themselves\n",
      "free from mines and torpedoes. It was in conditions such as these that our men carried on, with\n",
      "carried on, with little\n",
      "or no rest, for days and nights on end, making trip after trip across the dangerous waters,\n",
      "dangerous waters, bringing\n",
      "with them always men whom they had rescued. The numbers they have brought back are the measure\n",
      "of their devotion and their courage. The hospital ships, which brought off many thousands of\n",
      "many thousands of British\n",
      "and French wounded, being so plainly marked were a special target for Nazi bombs; but the men and\n",
      "women on board them never faltered in their duty.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Royal Air Force, which had already been intervening in the battle, so far as its\n",
      "so far as its range\n",
      "would allow, from home bases, now used part of its main metropolitan fighter strength, and struck\n",
      "and struck at\n",
      "the German bombers and at the fighters which in large numbers protected them. This struggle was\n",
      "protracted and fierce. Suddenly the scene has cleared, the crash and thunder has for the moment-but\n",
      "only for the moment-died away. A miracle of deliverance, achieved by valor, by perseverance, by\n",
      "perfect discipline, by faultless service, by resource, by skill, by unconquerable fidelity, is\n",
      "fidelity, is manifest to\n",
      "us all. The enemy was hurled back by the retreating British and French troops. He was so roughly\n",
      "handled that he did not hurry their departure seriously. The Royal Air Force engaged the main\n",
      "strength of the German Air Force, and inflicted upon them losses of at least four to one; and the\n",
      "Navy, using nearly 1,000 ships of all kinds, carried over 335,000 men, French and British, out of\n",
      "and British, out of the\n",
      "jaws of death and shame, to their native land and to the tasks which lie immediately ahead. We must\n",
      "be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by\n",
      "evacuations. But there was a victory inside this deliverance, which should be noted. It was gained\n",
      "It was gained by\n",
      "the Air Force. Many of our soldiers coming back have not seen the Air Force at work; they saw only\n",
      "the bombers which escaped its protective attack. They underrate its achievements. I have heard much\n",
      "talk of this; that is why I go out of my way to say this. I will tell you about it.\n",
      "This was a great trial of strength between the British and German Air Forces. Can you conceive a\n",
      "greater objective for the Germans in the air than to make evacuation from these beaches impossible,\n",
      "and to sink all these ships which were displayed, almost to the extent of thousands? Could there\n",
      "Could there have\n",
      "been an objective of greater military importance and significance for the whole purpose of the war\n",
      "than this? They tried hard, and they were beaten back; they were frustrated in their task. We got\n",
      "their task. We got the\n",
      "Army away; and they have paid fourfold for any losses which they have inflicted. Very large\n",
      "formations of German aeroplanes-and we know that they are a very brave race-have turned on\n",
      "several occasions from the attack of one-quarter of their number of the Royal Air Force, and have\n",
      "dispersed in different directions. Twelve aeroplanes have been hunted by two. One aeroplane was\n",
      "driven into the water and cast away by the mere charge of a British aeroplane, which had no more\n",
      "ammunition. All of our types-the Hurricane, the Spitfire and the new Defiant-and all our pilots\n",
      "all our pilots have\n",
      "been vindicated as superior to what they have at present to face.\n",
      "When we consider how much greater would be our advantage in defending the air above this Island\n",
      "against an overseas attack, I must say that I find in these facts a sure basis upon which practical\n",
      "which practical and\n",
      "reassuring thoughts may rest. I will pay my tribute to these young airmen. The great French Army\n",
      "was very largely, for the time being, cast back and disturbed by the onrush of a few thousands of\n",
      "armored vehicles. May it not also be that the cause of civilization itself will be defended by the\n",
      "be defended by the skill\n",
      "and devotion of a few thousand airmen? There never has been, I suppose, in all the world, in all\n",
      "the world, in all the\n",
      "history of war, such an opportunity for youth. The Knights of the Round Table, the Crusaders, all\n",
      "the Crusaders, all fall\n",
      "back into the past-not only distant but prosaic; these young men, going forth every morn to guard\n",
      "their native land and all that we stand for, holding in their hands these instruments of colossal\n",
      "of colossal and\n",
      "shattering power, of whom it may be said that\n",
      "Every morn brought forth a noble chance\n",
      "And every chance brought forth a noble knight,\n",
      "deserve our gratitude, as do all the brave men who, in so many ways and on so many occasions, are\n",
      "ready, and continue ready to give life and all for their native land.\n",
      "I return to the Army. In the long series of very fierce battles, now on this front, now on that,\n",
      "front, now on that, fighting\n",
      "on three fronts at once, battles fought by two or three divisions against an equal or somewhat\n",
      "equal or somewhat larger\n",
      "number of the enemy, and fought fiercely on some of the old grounds that so many of us knew so\n",
      "many of us knew so wellin these battles our losses in men have exceeded 30,000 killed, wounded and\n",
      "killed, wounded and missing. I take occasion\n",
      "to express the sympathy of the House to all who have suffered bereavement or who are still anxious.\n",
      "The President of the Board of Trade [Sir Andrew Duncan] is not here today. His son has been killed,\n",
      "and many in the House have felt the pangs of affliction in the sharpest form. But I will say this\n",
      "But I will say this about\n",
      "the missing: We have had a large number of wounded come home safely to this country, but I would\n",
      "say about the missing that there may be very many reported missing who will come back home, some\n",
      "day, in one way or another. In the confusion of this fight it is inevitable that many have been\n",
      "that many have been left in\n",
      "positions where honor required no further resistance from them.\n",
      "Against this loss of over 30,000 men, we can set a far heavier loss certainly inflicted upon the\n",
      "inflicted upon the enemy.\n",
      "But our losses in material are enormous. We have perhaps lost one-third of the men we lost in the\n",
      "opening days of the battle of 21st March, 1918, but we have lost nearly as many guns -- nearly one\n",
      "thousand-and all our transport, all the armored vehicles that were with the Army in the north. This\n",
      "loss will impose a further delay on the expansion of our military strength. That expansion had not\n",
      "been proceeding as far as we had hoped. The best of all we had to give had gone to the British\n",
      "Expeditionary Force, and although they had not the numbers of tanks and some articles of equipment\n",
      "which were desirable, they were a very well and finely equipped Army. They had the first-fruits of\n",
      "the first-fruits of all\n",
      "that our industry had to give, and that is gone. And now here is this further delay. How long it\n",
      "delay. How long it will be,\n",
      "how long it will last, depends upon the exertions which we make in this Island. An effort the like\n",
      "An effort the like of\n",
      "which has never been seen in our records is now being made. Work is proceeding everywhere, night\n",
      "and day, Sundays and week days. Capital and Labor have cast aside their interests, rights, and\n",
      "customs and put them into the common stock. Already the flow of munitions has leaped forward.\n",
      "There is no reason why we should not in a few months overtake the sudden and serious loss that has\n",
      "come upon us, without retarding the development of our general program.\n",
      "Nevertheless, our thankfulness at the escape of our Army and so many men, whose loved ones have\n",
      "passed through an agonizing week, must not blind us to the fact that what has happened in France\n",
      "and Belgium is a colossal military disaster. The French Army has been weakened, the Belgian Army\n",
      "has been lost, a large part of those fortified lines upon which so much faith had been reposed is\n",
      "had been reposed is gone,\n",

      "expect another blow to be struck almost immediately at us or at France. We are told that Herr\n",

      "for their own sakes as well as for ours. There is, however, another class, for which I feel not the\n",
