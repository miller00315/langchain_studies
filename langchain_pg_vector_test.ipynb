The French High Command hoped they would be able to close the gap, and\\nthe Armies of the north were under their orders. Moreover, a retirement of this kind would have\\ninvolved almost certainly the destruction of the fine Belgian Army of over 20 divisions and the\\nabandonment of the whole of Belgium. Therefore, when the force and scope of the German\\npenetration were realized and when a new French Generalissimo, General Weygand, assumed\\ncommand in place of General Gamelin, an effort was made by the French and British Armies in'), Document(metadata={'source': './data/churchill_speech.txt'}, page_content='Belgium to keep on holding the right hand of the Belgians and to give their own right hand to a newly\\ncreated French Army which was to have advanced across the Somme in great strength to grasp it.\\nHowever, the German eruption swept like a sharp scythe around the right and rear of the Armies of\\nthe north. Eight or nine armored divisions, each of about four hundred armored vehicles of different\\nkinds, but carefully assorted to be complementary and divisible into small self-contained units, cut off\\nall communications between us and the main French Armies. It severed our own communications for\\nfood and ammunition, which ran first to Amiens and afterwards through Abbeville, and it shore its\\nway up the coast to Boulogne and Calais, and almost to Dunkirk.

The Rifle Brigade, the 60th Rifles, and the Queen\\nVictoria's Rifles, with a battalion of British tanks and 1,000 Frenchmen, in all about four thousand\\nstrong, defended Calais to the last. The British Brigadier was given an hour to surrender. He spurned\\nthe offer, and four days of intense street fighting passed before silence reigned over Calais, which\\nmarked the end of a memorable resistance.

When it was found impossible for the Armies of\\nthe north to reopen their communications to Amiens with the main French Armies, only one choice\\nremained. It seemed, indeed, forlorn. The Belgian, British and French Armies were almost\\nsurrounded. Their sole line of retreat was to a single port and to its neighboring beaches. They were\\npressed on every side by heavy attacks and far outnumbered in the air.\\nWhen, a week ago today, I asked the House to fix this afternoon as the occasion for a statement, I\\nfeared it would be my hard lot to announce the greatest military disaster in our long history.
